## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

  ### Defining a function with a single argument 'data'
  my_data_function1 <- function(data1) {
  
  ##### Performing simple transformation: using head() to obtain the first 10 rows of the dataset
  data_transformation1 <- head(data1, 10)
 
  ####### Returning data transformation
  return(data_transformation1)
}

#### Working on a built-in dataset
built_in_dataset1 <- my_data_function1(mtcars)
print(built_in_dataset1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
